# Digit-Recognition-using-SVM
Digit recognition using Support Vector Machines (SVM) for EMNIST data refers to the task of building an SVM model, to identify and classify digits (0-9) in the Extended MNIST (EMNIST) dataset.

Task: 
The goal is to develop a system that can automatically recognize and classify handwritten digits. For example, given an image containing a handwritten digit, the system should predict which digit it represents.
Support Vector Machines (SVM):

Algorithm: 
SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. In the context of digit recognition, SVM can be trained on a dataset of labeled digit images to learn patterns and boundaries that distinguish between different digits.
EMNIST Data:

Dataset: 
The EMNIST dataset is an extension of the MNIST dataset, which is widely used for digit recognition tasks. EMNIST includes both characters and digits, making it suitable for more diverse recognition tasks. In this case, you are specifically focusing on recognizing digits within the EMNIST dataset.

Implementation Steps:
* Data Loading: Load the EMNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels (the digit they represent).
* Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for training and testing, which may involve normalization, resizing, or other preprocessing steps.
* SVM Model Training: Use the SVM algorithm to train a model on the labeled training data, where the features are the pixel values of the digit images, and the labels are the corresponding digit classes.
* Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance on a separate test set to ensure its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
* Prediction: After training, the SVM model can be used to predict the digit class of new, unseen handwritten digit images.
